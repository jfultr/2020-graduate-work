# 2020-graduate-work
my graduate work about using ML and Neural Networks in robotics

The project contains a firmware for NucleoL031K6T6 and code for communication between a PC and a robot chassis.
Robot commands are sent from PC to Raspberry Pi, then communicated to the MCU via UART.
The camera on the raspberry pi sends a video stream to the computer. The robot searches for recognizable objects in the video stream.

Project is quite accomplished and requires serious reworking.
